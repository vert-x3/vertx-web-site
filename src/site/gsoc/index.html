      <h3>Vert.x-Web purely functional handlers</h3>
      <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
      <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Eclipse Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation
        of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. Use any function as a vertx-web handler, then provide an API
        to compose these functions in a "RouterBuilder API" way. This should be a totally separated project, keeping vertx-web
        as is for now and targeting "pure JVM languages" (Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala), especially those who have "first-level"
        functions (and maybe annotations).</p>

      <strong>What should be achieved:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>any lambda can now be used as a vert.x web handler, automatically resolving lambda parameters.</li>
        <li>provide the ability to deal with futures in vert.x-web, if a lambda is returning an AsyncResult, then:
          <ul>
            <li>the next handler should only be called once the future is completed.
              <li>the context should automatically been failed if the asyncresult is failed.
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>allow users to define custom parameters resolvers by implementing an interface such as Resolvable&lt;RoutingContext,
            T&gt; or AsyncResolvable&lt;RoutingContext, T&gt;.</li>
          <li>create a "builder-like" API on top of vertx-web's Router to deal with such lambdas.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For further reference and examples see the following <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vertx/01tCUjTm01s">google group post</a>.</p>

      <h3>Vertx-Web implement HTTP standard responses logic to Router</h3>
      <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
      <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Eclipse Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation
        of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. Vert.x Web Router is a general purpose router that matches
        paths to handlers. Although this is "good enough" for many applications it does not adhere properly to the HTTP protocol.
        The issue is more obvious since the API allows filtering on mime type but failure to match such a request does not
        respect the protocol.</p>

      <strong>Current inconsistent cases:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>A router contains a route path but with misses the right HTTP verb, instead of returning 404 it should return 405.</li>
        <li>A router contains a route for a specific mime type but the request contains a different payload mime type, instead
          of returning 404 it should return 406.</li>
        <li>A router contains a route that produces a specific mime type but the request requires a different payload mime type,
          instead of returning 404 it should return 415.</li>
        <li>An OPTIONS request should list the allowed verbs for the given path.</li>
        <li>Errors thrown during path parameter parsing should throw 400 instead of 500.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The project should start with a review of the HTTP protocol including version 2 and identify faulty situations as described
        above. A proposal for a refactoring of the internal of the Router class while keeping the existing API is a must.</p>

      <p>The code should be properly documented and easy to extend so later one can for example plug REST documentation generators,
        etc...</p>

      <h3>Vert.x R language support</h3>
      <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
      <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Eclipse Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation
        of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. R is an open source programming language and software environment
        for statistical computing and graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language
        is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.
        Polls, surveys of data miners, and studies of scholarly literature databases show that R's popularity has increased
        substantially in recent years.</p>

      <strong>What should be achieved:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>Propose a vertx-lang-r using <a href="http://www.renjin.org">renjin</a></li>

      <h3>Vert.x Certbot plugin</h3>
      <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
      <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Eclipse Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation
        of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications.</p>

      <p><a href="https://certbot.eff.org">Certbot</a> is an easy-to-use automatic client that fetches and deploys SSL/TLS
        certificates for your webserver. Certbot was developed by EFF and others as a client for Let’s Encrypt and was
        previously known as “the official Let’s Encrypt client” or “the Let’s Encrypt Python client.” Certbot will also
        work with any other CAs that support the ACME protocol.</p>

        <p>Certbot has several plugins for common web servers and can be used in manual mode with Vert.x too. This
          project would be about <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/contributing.html">coding a new plugin</a> for Certbot
          that would make the use of SSL certificates even easier for the Vert.x user community. The Certbot project is very
          open to new plugins and there is plenty of documentation. The project would be to follow the intructions from
          the link above and implement a tighter integration with Vert.x.</p>

      <strong>What should be achieved:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>Get acquainted with Certbot Python API</li>
        <li>Writing a plugin for applications using Vert.x Core + Vert.x Web</li>
        <li>Submit a PR</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Vert.x on Embedded JDK</h3>
      <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
      <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Eclipse Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation
        of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. More and more Vert.x is getting used on IoT fields now that
        we offer support for MQTT and are lightweight when compared to other Java frameworks. It is important that Vert.x
        applications can run as expected under the embedded JDK using the compact profiles (<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/161">JEP-161</a>). </p>

      <strong>What should be achieved:</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>Document how to work with Embedded JDK:
          <ul>
            <li>How to build and Vert.x application with a compact profile.</li>
            <li>Identify if there are required changes to the core platform to cover this feature.</li>
            <li>Write articles on this subject.</li>
            <li>Work with the IoT community to identify usability issues and provide solutions.</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Implementation of “blueprint” Vert.x applications</h3>
      <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
      <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive,
        highly concurrent, polyglot applications. The idea of the project is to implement a set of applications using the
        Vert.x toolkit to illustrate how different classes of applications can be done. This project aims to provide guidelines
        to Vert.x users to implement various applications.</p>
      <p>The project starts with an introduction to Vert.x and the implementation of small examples using the different modules
        available in the Vert.x ecosystem. Then, the first application is a web application to manage a todo list following
        the specifications of <a href="http://www.todobackend.com/">Todo Backend</a>. The second application is a message-based
        application such as <a href="http://automattic.github.io/kue/">Kue</a>. The third application is also message-based
        but illustrates the scalability of Vert.x. It provides a message processing system able to handle a large number
        of message per seconds. Finally, the last application is a micro-service application close to the <a href="https://github.com/kbastani/spring-cloud-microservice-example">Spring Micro Service example</a>.</p>
      <p>Live demo of the applications will run on OpenShift and OpenStack, to illustrate production deployment. All these applications
        will be available and documented on the Vert.x website.</p>

      <h3>Event bus clients for C, Objective-C, and Rust applications</h3>
      <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
      <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive,
        highly concurrent, polyglot applications. Thanks to its eventbus, any application can interact with Vert.x applications.
        The idea of the project is to provide a set of libraries to ease the integration of Vert.x applications with applications
        developed in Go, Rust and C.</p>
      <p>The project starts with an introduction to Vert.x and the implementation of small examples using the different modules
        available in the Vert.x ecosystem. A focus is made on the integration capabilities and the event bus bridges.</p>
      <p>At least 3 languages are covered in this project: C, Objective-C and Rust. Proposals for other languages are definitely
        welcome. For each language, a library is developed in order to let an application developed with the language to
        interact with the Vert.x Event Bus. The communication is based on TCP and JSON.</p>
