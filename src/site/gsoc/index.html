          <h3>Implementation of “blueprint” Vert.x applications</h3>
          <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
          <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. The idea of the project is to implement a set of applications using the Vert.x toolkit to illustrate how different classes of applications can be done. This project aims to provide guidelines to Vert.x users to implement various applications.</p>
          <p>The project starts with an introduction to Vert.x and the implementation of small examples using the different modules available in the Vert.x ecosystem. Then, the first application is a web application to manage a todo list following the specifications of <a href="http://www.todobackend.com/">Todo Backend</a>. The second application is a message-based application such as <a href="http://automattic.github.io/kue/">Kue</a>. The third application is also message-based but illustrates the scalability of Vert.x. It provides a message processing system able to handle a large number of message per seconds. Finally, the last application is a micro-service application close to the <a href="https://github.com/kbastani/spring-cloud-microservice-example">Spring Micro Service example</a>.</p>
          <p>Live demo of the applications will run on OpenShift and OpenStack, to illustrate production deployment.
          All these applications will be available and documented on the Vert.x website.</p>

            <h3>DevOps tooling for Vert.x applications</h3>
            <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
            <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. The idea of the project is to implement a set of tools / guidelines to implement Vert.x using a “devops” approach. This cover continuous integration, continuous deployment, production settings and so on.</p>
            <p>The project starts with an introduction to Vert.x and the implementation of small examples using the different modules available in the Vert.x ecosystem. In this project, you are going to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>provide the different settings to use different log aggregator that can be used with Vert.x application. This includes Graylog and Heka.</li>
            <li>monitor applications based on New Relic, Netflix Servo are studied.</li>
            <li>provide deployment recipes for Ansible and Chef</li>
            <li>provide guidelines to implement continuous delivery of Vert.x application, in a zero-downtime environment</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong> Java (8), Jenkins, Gradle or Maven is a plus<br/>
            <strong>Skill level:</strong> Intermediate, Experienced<br/>

              <h3>Event bus clients for Go, C, and Rust applications</h3>
              <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
              <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. Thanks to its eventbus, any application can interact with Vert.x applications. The idea of the project is to provide a set of libraries to ease the integration of Vert.x applications with applications developed in Go, Rust and C.</p>
              <p>The project starts with an introduction to Vert.x and the implementation of small examples using the different modules available in the Vert.x ecosystem. A focus is made on the integration capabilities and the event bus bridges.</p>
              <p>At least 3 languages are covered in this project: Go, C and Rust. Proposals for other languages are definitely welcome. For each language, a library is developed in order to let an application developed with the language to interact with the Vert.x Event Bus. The communication is based on TCP and JSON.</p>
