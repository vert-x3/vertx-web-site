We are extremely pleased to announce that the Eclipse Vert.x version 3.7.0 has been released.

It is an exciting milestone for a couple of reasons:

1. it comes with great new features like the [GraphQL extension for Vert.x Web](#vertx-web-graphql).
2. this is the last minor version before Vert.x 4! 

Before we go throught the most notable new features, we would like to thank all the contributors.
Your participation has been essential to this achievement.

#### <a id="vertx-web-graphql">Vert.x Web GraphQL</a>

Vert.x Web GraphQL extends Vert.x Web with the [GraphQL-Java](https://www.graphql-java.com) library so that you can build a GraphQL server.

To use this new module, add the following to the _dependencies_ section of your Maven POM file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-web-graphql</artifactId>
  <version>3.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, if you use Gradle:

```
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-web-graphql:3.7.0'
```

Then create a Vert.x Web `Route` and a `GraphQLHandler` for it:
     
```java
// Setup the GraphQL-Java object
GraphQL graphQL = setupGraphQLJava();
// Use it to handle requests on a Vert.x Web route 
router.route("/graphql").handler(GraphQLHandler.create(graphQL));
```

The GraphQL handler supports out of the box:

- query context customization
- GraphQL-Java data loaders
- batching on `POST` requests (compatible with the [`apollo-link-batch-http`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/batch-http.html) transport)

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [Vert.x Web GraphQL documentation](/docs/vertx-web-graphql/java/).

#### Vert.x Cassandra Client

TODO (mappers, collectors, cursors)

#### Vert.x Redis Client

TODO (Paulo)

#### Stream pipes

TODO (Julien)

#### Kafka admin client

The new version brings a Vert.x based first implementation of the native [Kafka Admin Client API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#adminapi) which are in Java, instead of Scala used in the previous version.

The `AdminUtils` is now deprecated and the new `KafkaAdminClient` is available instead.
It allows to remove the last Scala dependency.
One more interesting thing is that, while the `AdminUtils` implementation needs to connect to Zookeeper for administration purposes, the `KafkaAdminClient` just uses the Kafka bootstrap brokers connection.

```java
Properties config = new Properties();
config.put(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "my-kafka-broker:9092");

KafkaAdminClient adminClient = KafkaAdminClient.create(vertx, config);
```

The features currently supported are:

- create and delete topics
- list all the topics
- describe topics for getting information about leader partition, follower replicas and ISR (in-sync replicas) list
- alter topics configuration
- list all consumer groups
- describe consumer groups for getting information like the state, the coordinator host, consumers per topics and so on

Please, if you are using the `AdminUtils` today, consider to migrate to the new `KafkaAdminClient` because the former will be removed soon.

#### And more...

Here are some other important improvements you can find in this release:
