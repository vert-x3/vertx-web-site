We are extremely pleased to announce that the Eclipse Vert.x version 3.7.0 has been released.

It is an exciting milestone for a couple of reasons:

1. it comes with great new features like the [GraphQL extension for Vert.x Web](#vertx-web-graphql).
2. this is the last minor version before Vert.x 4! 

Before we go throught the most notable new features, we would like to thank all the contributors.
Your participation has been essential to this achievement.

#### <a id="vertx-web-graphql">Vert.x Web GraphQL</a>

Vert.x Web GraphQL extends Vert.x Web with the [GraphQL-Java](https://www.graphql-java.com) library so that you can build a GraphQL server.

To use this new module, add the following to the _dependencies_ section of your Maven POM file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-web-graphql</artifactId>
  <version>3.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, if you use Gradle:

```
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-web-graphql:3.7.0'
```

Then create a Vert.x Web `Route` and a `GraphQLHandler` for it:
     
```java
// Setup the GraphQL-Java object
GraphQL graphQL = setupGraphQLJava();
// Use it to handle requests on a Vert.x Web route 
router.route("/graphql").handler(GraphQLHandler.create(graphQL));
```

The GraphQL handler supports out of the box:

- query context customization
- GraphQL-Java data loaders
- batching on `POST` requests (compatible with the [`apollo-link-batch-http`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/batch-http.html) transport)

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [Vert.x Web GraphQL documentation](/docs/vertx-web-graphql/java/).

#### Vert.x Cassandra Client

##### Object mapper support

Vert.x Cassandra Client now supports the [cassandra-driver-mapping](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/tree/3.x/manual/object_mapper) module.

To enable this feature, you need to update your classpath by adding:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.cassandra</groupId>
  <artifactId>cassandra-driver-mapping</artifactId>
  <version>3.7.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Then for a given entity: 

```java
@Table(keyspace = "test", name = "users")
class User {
  @PartitionKey String name;
  // ... other fields and methods 
}
```

You can retrieve a mapper and execute CRUD operations:

```java
VertxMappingManager manager = VertxMappingManager.create(cassandraClient);
VertxMapper<User> mapper = manager.mapper(User.class, vertx);
mapper.save(new User("john", hander -> {}));
```

##### Collector API 

The feature allows to use Java [collectors](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collector.html) for query results:

```java
// Create a collector projecting a row set to a string in the form (last_name_1,last_name_2,...)
Collector<Row, ?, String> collector = Collectors.mapping(
    row -> row.getString("last_name"),
    Collectors.joining(",", "(", ")")
);

// Run the query with the collector
client.execute("SELECT * FROM users", collector, ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    // Result in the form (last_name_1,last_name_2,...)
    String result = ar.result();
  } else {
    System.out.println("Failure: " + ar.cause().getMessage());
  }
});
```

##### Cursor API

The `ResultSet` object has been enhanced with `ResultSet#several` method, allowing you to obtain several rows at once:

```java
resultSet.several(30, ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    List<Row> result = ar.result();
  } else {
    System.out.println("Failure: " + ar.cause().getMessage());
  }
});
```

A very useful feature for result batch iterations without resorting to streaming or fetching all rows in memory.

##### Client lifecyle

The client lifecyle has been revisited in 3.7.

Previously users expected to `connect` manually before sending requests. It was also possible to `disconnect` a shared client
thus failing requests sent from another verticle or part of the application.

Now it is no longer required to manually connect a client (in fact, the method has been removed).

As soon as you retrieve an instance you can start using it, the lifecyle is automatically managed:

```java
CassandraClientOptions options = new CassandraClientOptions()
  .addContactPoint("node1.address")
  .addContactPoint("node2.address")
  .addContactPoint("node3.address")
  .setKeyspace("my_keyspace");
CassandraClient sharedClient = CassandraClient.createShared(vertx, "sharedClientName", options);
// Start sending requests to Cassandra with the client instance
```

Similarly, when the new `close` method is invoked on a shared client, only the last active instance will actually disconnect from Cassandra:

```java
// Disconnects only if this is the last running instance of the shared client
sharedClient.close();
```

#### Vert.x Redis Client

The Vert.x Redis client has been reworked internally and provides now a new (more evolution friendly) API.

The current API had the limitation of being manually crafted after the redis API and involved many non controlable features
such as auto reconnect, unlimited buffering of requests, etc... The new API offers a more _vert.x-y_ experience.

It just exposes the base client:

```java
Redis
  .createClient(vertx, inetSocketAddress(7006, "127.0.0.1"))
  .connect(create -> {
    final Redis redis = create.result();

    redis.send(Request.cmd(Command.PING), send -> {
      // ... should reply with PONG
    });
  });
```

This has the benefits that you can now connect to Redis in any of it's operation modes:

* Single server
* HA mode
* Cluster mode

The API is decoupled from the handcrafted commands, which means that you can use new features such as:

* [streams](https://redis.io/commands#stream)
* [hyperloglog](https://redis.io/commands#hyperloglog)
* [any extension module](https://github.com/RedisLabsModules)

A generated helper `RedisAPI` is available that can wrap the client to provide a similar experience to the old API.

The main difference is that this new wrapper is generated from the [COMMAND](https://redis.io/commands/command) command,
so the correct API it always exposed:

```java
RedisAPI redis = RedisAPI.api(client);

redis.set(Arrays.asList("key1", "value1"), set -> {
  // ...
});
```

#### Vert.x AMQP Client

The Vert.x AMQP client allows receiving and sending AMQP messages. It supersedes the current AMQP bridge and provide an API more
flexible and very much user-friendly.

The Vert.x AMQP client allows:

* Connecting to an AMQP broker or router - SASL and TLS connections are supported
* Consuming message from a queue or a topic
* Sending messages to a queue or a topic
* Checking acknowledgement for sent messages

The AMQP 1.0 protocol support durable subscriptions, persistence, security, conversations, sophisticated routing... More
 details on the protocol can be found on the [AMQP homepage](https://www.amqp.org/).

The Vert.x AMQP client is based on Vert.x Proton. If you need fine-grain control, we recommend using
[Vert.x Proton](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-proton) directly.

To use this new module, add the following to the _dependencies_ section of your Maven POM file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-amqp-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, if you use Gradle:

```
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-amqp-client:3.7.0'
```

Then, you can connect to an AMQP broker:

```java
AmqpClientOptions options = new AmqpClientOptions()
      .setHost("localhost")
      .setPort(5672)
      .setUsername("user")
      .setPassword("secret");
    
AmqpClient client = AmqpClient.create(vertx, options);

client.connect(ar -> {
  if (ar.failed()) {
    System.out.println("Unable to connect to the broker");
  } else {
    System.out.println("Connection succeeded");
    AmqpConnection connection = ar.result();

    // You can create receivers and senders
    connection.createReceiver("my-queue",
      msg -> {
        // called on every received messages
        System.out.println("Received " + msg.bodyAsString());
      },
      done -> {
        if (done.failed()) {
          System.out.println("Unable to create receiver");
        } else {
          AmqpReceiver receiver = done.result();
        }
      }
    );

    connection.createSender("my-queue", done -> {
      if (done.failed()) {
        System.out.println("Unable to create a sender");
      } else {
        AmqpSender sender = done.result();
        sender.send(AmqpMessage.create().withBody("hello").build());
      }
    });

  }
});
```

#### Stream pipes

When it comes to streaming, back-pressure is something you need to care about.

You have very much likely heard or used the Vert.x `Pump` API to transfer data from a read stream to a write stream while
respecting the write stream back-pressure.

The `Pipe` a new API superseding the `Pump` to achieve the same effect and even more, it acts like a pump and handles for you

- read stream pause/resume
- write stream termination
- stream failures handling
- asynchronous result upon streaming completion

You can transfer a read stream to a write stream simply, the write stream will be ended upon completion of the stream

```java
readStream.pipeTo(writeStream);
```

You can also be notified when the pipe completes:

```java
readStream.pipeTo(writeStream, ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    System.out.println("done");
  } else {
    System.out.println("failed " + ar.cause());
  }
});
```

Creating and using an asynchronous pipe is easy

```java
// The read stream will be paused until the pipe is used
Pipe<Buffer> pipe = readStream.pipe();
getAsyncPipe(ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    pipe.to(writeStream);
  } else {
    pipe.close();
  }
});
```

#### Kafka admin client

The new version brings a Vert.x based first implementation of the native [Kafka Admin Client API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#adminapi)
which are in Java, instead of Scala used in the previous version.

The `AdminUtils` is now deprecated and the new `KafkaAdminClient` is available instead.
It allows to remove the last Scala artifact dependency.

While the `AdminUtils` implementation needs to connect to Zookeeper for administration purposes,
the `KafkaAdminClient` only uses the Kafka bootstrap brokers connection.

```java
Properties config = new Properties();
config.put(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "my-kafka-broker:9092");

KafkaAdminClient adminClient = KafkaAdminClient.create(vertx, config);
```

The features currently supported are:

- create and delete topics
- list all the topics
- describe topics for getting information about leader partition, follower replicas and ISR (in-sync replicas) list
- alter topics configuration
- list all consumer groups
- describe consumer groups for getting information like the state, the coordinator host, consumers per topics and so on

If you are using the `AdminUtils` today, consider migrate to the new `KafkaAdminClient` because the former will be removed in Vert.x 4.0.

#### And more...

Here are some other important improvements you can find in this release:

- Shared data structures available in local-only mode even when Vert.x is clustered
- JSON decoding without prior knowledge of the structure (object, array, string, ...etc)
- Infinispan Cluster Manager upgraded to [Infinispan](https://infinispan.org) 9.4.10.Final
- And obviously we have the usual bug fixes!
