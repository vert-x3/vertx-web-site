We are extremely pleased to announce the first 4.0 beta release of Eclipse Vert.x .

Vert.x 4 is the evolution of the Vert.x 3.x series that will bring key features to Vert.x.

#### Item 1

Blah...

#### Ramping up to Vert.x 4

Instead of developing all new features exclusively in Vert.x 4, we introduce some of these features in the 3.x branch
so the community can benefit from them. The Vert.x 4 development focus on more fundamental changes that cannot be done
in the 3.x series.
