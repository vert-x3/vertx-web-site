We are extremely pleased to announce that the Eclipse Vert.x version 3.8.0 has been released.

This is an important release that introduces a few changes ramping up to Vert.x 4 expected by the end of this year.

#### <a id="">The Reactive SQL Client</a>

The client is the evolution of the legendary *Reactive PostgreSQL Client* and provides

* The Reactive PostgreSQL Client aka Vert.x PostgreSQL Client
* The Reactive MySQL Client aka Vert.x MySQL Client

These implementations provide real high performance non-blocking access to PostgreSQL and MySQL.

To use these new modules, add the following to the _dependencies_ section of your Maven POM file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-pg-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.8.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-mysql-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.8.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, if you use Gradle:

```
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-pg-client:3.8.0'
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-mysql-client:3.8.0'
```

Then you are good to go!

```java
// Connect options
PgConnectOptions connectOptions = new PgConnectOptions()
  .setPort(5432)
  .setHost("the-host")
  .setDatabase("the-db")
  .setUser("user")
  .setPassword("secret");

PgPool client = PgPool.pool(connectOptions, new PoolOptions().setMaxSize(5));

client.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id='julien'", ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    RowSet result = ar.result();
    System.out.println("Got " + result.size() + " rows ");
  } else {
    System.out.println("Failure: " + ar.cause().getMessage());
  }
});
```

Likewise you can achieve the same for MySQL:

```java
MySQLConnectOptions connectOptions = new MySQLConnectOptions()
  .setPort(3306)
  .setHost("the-host")
  .setDatabase("the-db")
  .setUser("user")
  .setPassword("secret");

MySQLPool client = MySQLPool.pool(connectOptions, new PoolOptions().setMaxSize(5));

client.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id='julien'", ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    RowSet result = ar.result();
    System.out.println("Got " + result.size() + " rows ");
  } else {
    System.out.println("Failure: " + ar.cause().getMessage());
  }
});
```

The *Reactive SQL Client* brings to you the next generation database access, it is certainly the most exciting
thing happening in the reactive database access space.

#### Future API improvements

In this release we updated the Vert.x `Future` interface to expose completion methods in a new `Promise` interface.

This improves the design of the API of `Future` by having `Promise` being the write side of an asynchronous result
and the `Future` being its read side.

While there is little use for this in Vert.x 3.x, this has an impact on Vert.x 4.

Consequently some method signatures have been changed to use `Promise` instead of `Future` explained in this [page](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/3.8.0-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes#future-creation-and-completion).

#### Upgrading to 3.8

Upgrading to 3.8.0 might require a few changes in your application, you can read this [page](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/3.8.0-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes#future-creation-and-completion) to understand the impact of the
3.8 release on your application upgrade.

#### And more...

Here are some other important improvements you can find in this release:

- Cassandra Client gets out of tech preview
- Jackson upgrade to 2.9.9 and databind 2.9.9.1
- And obviously we have the usual bug fixes!

#### Finally
